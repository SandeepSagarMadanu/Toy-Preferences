# Toy Preferences by Color, Shape, and Texture
* This project investigates toy preferences in infants based on three key attributes: color, shape, and texture. Using synthetic data, the notebook simulates infant responses and utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques to better understand behavioral patterns and preferences.

* 📌 Project Description
- Infant toy preferences can provide meaningful insights for toy manufacturers, child psychologists, and early learning researchers. This project uses generated toy preference data to:

- Analyze how infants respond to different toy attributes

- Visualize the trends in preferences

- Identify dominant factors (color, shape, texture) influencing preferences

* 🔍 Features
- Synthetic dataset creation mimicking infant behavior

- Visualizations for:

- Attribute frequency (color, shape, texture)

- Preference distributions

- Multivariate analysis

- Clean, modular structure using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn

- Simple and intuitive exploratory workflow

* 📊 Dataset
- The data used in this notebook is synthetically generated and not sourced from a real-world infant study. The following attributes are included:

- Toy_Color: e.g., Red, Blue, Green, Yellow

- Toy_Shape: e.g., Round, Square, Triangle

- Toy_Texture: e.g., Soft, Rough, Smooth

- Infant_Response: e.g., Like, Dislike

* 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Univariate analysis of each feature

- Bivariate visualizations comparing preferences with toy attributes

- Stacked bar charts and count plots for visual breakdowns

* 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

- Jupyter Notebook

- Libraries:

- pandas

- numpy

- matplotlib

- seaborn

* 🚀 How to Run
- Clone this repository:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the notebook:

* ✅ Results
- Infants showed strong preferences for specific combinations of color and texture.

- Colors like Red and Blue were often favored.

- Softer textures had a higher preference rating.

* 📚 Future Work
- Incorporate real-world behavioral data

- Add ML models to predict infant preference based on toy features

- Extend dataset with age or gender attributes
